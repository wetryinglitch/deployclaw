### Post 1: The Hook
Most founders spend 3 hours/day managing email.

We deploy an AI that does it for them — on their own hardware, fully private.

Same-day setup. Starting at $1,248.

### Post 2: The Comparison
Cloud AI assistants: your data goes to someone else's servers
OpenClaw: runs on a Mac mini under your desk

We deploy and maintain it for you. White-glove, same-day.

20% cheaper than the competition.

### Post 3: The Social Proof
OpenClaw was featured in Fast Company, MacStories, IBM Think, and Cisco's AI blog.

It's the most powerful open-source AI assistant out there.

The problem? Setting it up takes real engineering work.

That's why we exist. We deploy it for your team in one day.

### Post 4: The Thread 🧵
🧵 Why every founder needs an AI executive assistant in 2026:

1/ You're drowning in email. 200+ messages/day, most of which don't need YOUR attention. An AI can triage, draft, and handle 80% of it.

2/ Your calendar is a warzone. Double-bookings, timezone math, back-and-forth scheduling. AI handles all of it.

3/ Your team wastes hours on repetitive workflows. Status updates, report generation, data entry. Automate it.

4/ The best part? This doesn't have to live in the cloud. OpenClaw runs on YOUR hardware. Your data never leaves your network.

5/ We deploy it for exec teams — fully configured, secured, and live same-day. Starting at $1,248.

20% cheaper than anyone else. deployclaw.com

### Post 5: The Controversial Take
Hot take: If your AI assistant runs on someone else's server, it's not YOUR assistant.

It's theirs. They just let you use it.

OpenClaw runs on a $600 Mac mini under your desk. We set it up for you.

### LinkedIn Post 1:
I keep meeting founders who want AI leverage but are worried about:
❌ Data privacy
❌ Vendor lock-in
❌ Another subscription

Here's the move: OpenClaw is open-source, runs on your own hardware, and connects to 10,000+ tools.

The catch? Setting it up right (security hardening, integrations, credential management) takes real work.

That's exactly what we do at DeployClaw. White-glove deployment, same-day go-live, 14-day hypercare.

Starting at $1,248. DM me if your team could use this.

### LinkedIn Post 2:
Hiring an executive assistant: $55-80K/year

Runs 24/7. Never takes PTO. Lives on your hardware.

We deploy it for you. Same day.

This isn't science fiction. This is what we do at DeployClaw.
