# DeployClaw — Cold Email Sequences

## Sequence 1: "The DIY Pain" (for founders who know about OpenClaw)

### Email 1 — Day 0 (Initial)
**Subject:** You're probably spending 6+ hours setting up OpenClaw wrong

Hey {{first_name}},

Saw {{company}} is growing fast — congrats. Quick question: is anyone on your team running OpenClaw yet?

Most founders I talk to either:
a) Spent a weekend setting it up and it's half-broken
b) Want to but don't have the engineering bandwidth
c) Have it running but no security hardening

We deploy OpenClaw for exec teams — fully configured, hardened, and live same-day. Starting at $1,248 (that's 20% less than the other guys).

Your AI assistant handles email triage, scheduling, drafts, and workflows across 10,000+ integrations. On YOUR hardware, not someone else's cloud.

Worth a 15-min call?

### Email 2 — Day 3 (Value Add)
**Subject:** Re: How {{similar_company}} saved 15hrs/week with one agent

{{first_name}},

Quick follow-up — wanted to share how teams your size are using this:

- **CEO agent**: Triages 200+ emails/day, drafts replies, manages calendar
- **Sales agent**: Auto-researches prospects, drafts personalized outreach
- **EA agent**: Coordinates across the entire exec team

Most 4-50 person teams deploy 2-6 agents. Each one is like hiring a $60K/year employee that works 24/7 and never takes PTO.

Setup takes one day. We handle everything.

### Email 3 — Day 7 (FOMO/Urgency)
**Subject:** Re: Last note on this

{{first_name}},

Not trying to fill your inbox — just wanted to make sure this landed.

We're onboarding 3 new teams this month and have 2 slots left. If you're even slightly curious about having an AI handle your email, calendar, and repetitive workflows, let's do a quick 15-min call.

No pitch deck. No demo. Just a conversation about what's eating your time.

If now isn't the right time, no worries — just reply "later" and I'll check back in a month.

## Sequence 2: "The Security Angle" (for CTOs/technical founders)

### Email 1 — Day 0
**Subject:** Your team is probably running shadow AI

{{first_name}},

Here's what I keep seeing: someone on the team signs up for ChatGPT Enterprise, pipes company data through it, and nobody in leadership knows until there's an incident.

There's a better way. OpenClaw runs entirely on YOUR hardware — your email, calendar, and workflows never leave your network. But setting it up properly (credential management, network binding, audit trails) takes real expertise.

That's what we do. White-glove deployment, security hardening following the official guide, live same-day. Starting at $1,248.

15 minutes to see if it fits?

## Sequence 3: "The Competitor Switcher" (for teams already using SetupClaw or similar)

### Email 1 — Day 0
**Subject:** Same OpenClaw deployment, 20% less

{{first_name}},

If you're already paying for managed OpenClaw deployment, this might save you real money.

We offer the same white-glove service — deploy, harden, integrate, maintain — at 20% lower cost. Same 14-day hypercare. Same dedicated support channel. Remote-first, not limited to SF.

**Care Standard**: $1,960/mo (vs $2,450)
**Care Plus**: $3,900/mo (vs $4,875)

Happy to do a quick comparison call — no commitment.

## Sequence 4: "The Cold Intro" (for founders who don't know about OpenClaw)

### Email 1 — Day 0
**Subject:** What if your inbox managed itself?

{{first_name}},

What would you do with an extra 3 hours every day?

There's an open-source AI assistant called OpenClaw that can triage your email, manage your calendar, draft replies, and automate workflows — running entirely on your own hardware. Featured in Fast Company, MacStories, and IBM Think.

The catch: setting it up properly takes real engineering work. That's where we come in.

We deploy it for you, same-day, fully secured. Starting at $1,248 one-time + optional managed care.

Interested?
