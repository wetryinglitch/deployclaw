# DeployClaw — Cold DM Templates (Twitter/X & LinkedIn)

## Twitter/X DMs

### DM 1: The Direct Approach
Hey {{first_name}} — saw you're building {{company}}. Quick q: does your team use an AI assistant for email/calendar yet?

We deploy OpenClaw (open-source, runs on your hardware) for exec teams. Same-day setup, fully secured. Way cheaper than the alternatives.

Happy to chat if you're curious 🤙

### DM 2: The Value Hook
{{first_name}} — most founders I know spend 2-3 hours/day on email alone. 

We set up AI agents that handle email triage, scheduling, and drafts — running locally on a Mac mini. Fully private, no cloud dependency.

Takes one day to deploy. Want the details?

### DM 3: The Social Proof
Hey {{first_name}} — not sure if you've seen OpenClaw (featured in Fast Company + MacStories) but it's basically a 24/7 AI employee for your inbox and workflows.

We do the full deployment + security hardening for teams. Starting at $1,248.

Worth a quick chat?

### DM 4: Response to AI-related tweet
Great point about {{topic}}. We actually deploy AI assistants (OpenClaw) for exec teams — handles email, calendar, workflows, all running on local hardware.

If you ever want to test one for {{company}}, we can get you live in a day.

## LinkedIn DMs

### LinkedIn DM 1: Connection Request Note
Hi {{first_name}} — I help founders deploy AI assistants that run on their own hardware (no cloud, fully private). Thought this might be relevant for {{company}}. Would love to connect.

### LinkedIn DM 2: Post-Connection Follow-up
Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}! 

Quick question — how does your team currently handle email triage and scheduling? 

We deploy an open-source AI assistant (OpenClaw) that handles all of that automatically, running on your own machine. Most teams save 15-20 hours/week.

Happy to share more if you're interested.

### LinkedIn DM 3: The Case Study Approach
Hey {{first_name}} — we just helped a {{industry}} team of {{size}} deploy AI agents across their exec team. Their CEO now spends zero time on email triage.

If {{company}} could benefit from something similar, I'd love to chat for 15 min.

### LinkedIn DM 4: The Warm Referral
Hi {{first_name}} — {{mutual_connection}} suggested I reach out. We deploy AI assistants for exec teams (think: AI that handles your email, calendar, and workflows — on your hardware, fully private).

Would love to do a quick intro call if this sounds useful for {{company}}.

## Cold Call Script (Bland AI)

### Opening:
"Hi, is this {{first_name}}? Hey {{first_name}}, this is [Agent Name] from DeployClaw. I'll be super quick — I'm reaching out because we help teams like {{company}} deploy AI assistants that handle email, scheduling, and workflows. It runs on your own hardware, completely private. I was wondering if that's something your team might benefit from?"

### If interested:
"Great! So basically, we do a same-day deployment of an open-source AI called OpenClaw. It connects to your email, calendar, and over 10,000 other tools. It's like hiring a full-time executive assistant that works 24/7. The setup starts at $1,248 and we handle everything — security, integrations, the works. Can I book a quick 15-minute call to walk you through it?"

### If objection (too busy):
"Totally understand — that's actually exactly why this exists. It saves most founders 2-3 hours a day on inbox management alone. How about I send you a quick one-pager and you can check it out when you have a sec?"

### If objection (already have AI tools):
"Got it — most teams are using ChatGPT or similar. The difference here is this runs entirely on YOUR hardware — your data never leaves your machine. And it actually takes action — sends emails, books meetings, not just generates text. Worth a quick comparison?"

### Closing:
"Perfect, I'll send over the details. What's the best email for you? Great, you'll hear from us shortly. Thanks {{first_name}}, have a great day."
